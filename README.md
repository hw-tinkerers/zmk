[ZMK Firmware](https://zmk.dev/) is an open source ([MIT](LICENSE)) keyboard firmware built on the [Zephyr‚Ñ¢ Project](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) Real Time Operating System (RTOS). ZMK's goal is to provide a modern, wireless, and powerful firmware free of licensing issues.

To review features, check out the [feature overview](https://zmk.dev/docs/). ZMK is under active development, and new features are listed with the [enhancement label](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) in GitHub. Please feel free to add üëç to the issue description of any requests to upvote the feature. <br>

Steps to setup toolchain:

Before moving forward. If you have a Windows machine, please visit [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gc0QM4smeY) link to install dependencies and zephyr-sdk to build firmware (As it is a bit complex to use comman line to setup toolchain on windows). <br>

For Macos and Linux users:<br>

1. Install west

For macos:

```
pip3 install -U west
```

For Linux users:

```
pip3 install --user -U west
```

2. Verify West is installed (For Linux users):

```
west --version
```

This should print a message like "West version: v0.14.0". If it prints an error instead, make sure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH environment variable.

You can add it with these commands (For linux users):

```
echo 'export PATH=~/.local/bin:"$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Install Zephyr-sdk:<br>
   [Install Zephyr SDK](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.2.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-zephyr-sdk) <br>

4. Get source code:

```
git clone git@github.com:hw-tinkerers/zmk.git
```

5. setup the workspace

```
cd zmk
```

```
west init -l app/
```

```
west update
```

```
west zephyr-export
```

For mac and windows users:

```
pip3 install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
```

For linux users:

```
pip3 install --user -r zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
```

6. Build your code after customixing your keymap or default:<br>
   To know more about customizing keymaps visit [this](https://github.com/hw-tinkerers/tr60-zmk-config) link. <br>
   You have successfully setup your worksapce.
   To build your code to flash to TR60 keyboard, run this command.

```
west build -p auto -b tr60 app/
```

7. Copy your uf2 file to desktop to flash to your keyboard

```
cp build/zephyr/zmk.uf2 ~/Desktop
```

Or you can just copy paste the firmware file. Just find zmk.uf2 file under zephyr folder inside build folder.<br>

7. Flash your custom firmware and enjoy!!
